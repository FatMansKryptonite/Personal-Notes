# Short README

This is a repository to keep track of my personal and professional notes. It does however exclude sensitive information from projects I have worked on (for obvious reasons). 

## Viewing
Most files are provided in vanilla markdown format but some extensions provided by [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) can be found. For the best experience when reading this, I recommend also using Obsidian, download can be found [here](https://obsidian.md/download).
