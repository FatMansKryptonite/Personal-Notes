## Stable diffusion idea
- Use stable diffusion to generate component images made up of multiple other images on a web shop. 
- Have parts of the components be clickable as a "you might also like" link
- Auto generate these form website recommendations

- On hover image pixelates and provides additional information about product, quick add to cart button and link.

## Possible MVP
Rather than actually overlaying other clothes onto models. Identify the clothes the models are already wearing in other pages on the site and link to them in the same manner as before.

### Next Steps
- Implement different animations to show items more clearly.
- Identify items that are not already linked to on the site.
- Overlay automatically generated recommendations on images.
