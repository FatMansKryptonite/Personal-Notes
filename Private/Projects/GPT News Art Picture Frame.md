# Progress
Code is essentially finished and what remains is placing it on a raspberry pi and then making a frame!
# STEPS
1. Gather news of the day
	1. Prompt GPT with Bing search to summarise the top 5 news stories of the last 24 h
	2. Clean news stories and prepare for DALL E
2. Use news stories to prompt GPT with DALL E to create an image representing the news of the last 24 h.
	1. Select a news story or stories based on stories that have been covered recently
	2. Select a style based on styles that have been used recently
	3. Prompt GPT to use DALL E to generate an image based on selected news stories
3. Display image on screen together with text on an accompanying display
4. Save news stories, selected stories, prompt to DALL E and image
5. Enable a library to look at past images and stories
6. Backup and delete old generations as required
