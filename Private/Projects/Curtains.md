# Considerations
- [x] Do we want "double" curtains with a lighter one behind the thicker one?
- We want double curtains
- All curtains widths will need an extra 1.5-2.5 times extra to remain wavy when drawn
- We want curtains to be "touching" the floor. Real curtain length needs to be exactly the same length as distance from rod to floor
- We want a wide (10 cm) fold at the bottom
- [ ] Hanging (pleating styles). We want to go with
