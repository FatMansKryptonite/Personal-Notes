# Sydjysk Sparkasse
- When I have so much money I only need a Kreditforeningslån
	- I can borrow up to 80 % in this way
	- Sydbank cooperate with Totalkredit
	- Kreditforeninger have a fixed interest
	- 4 % (fixed) from all kreditforeninger no room for negotiation
	- But they can compete on fees
	- Variable interest
		- 6 months fixed interest (3 % interest)
		- 3 years
		- 5 years (3.8 % interest)
- I can choose any loan I like because of my loan
- They have a 5000 kr fee to start the loan
- When I sign købsaftale then they will write a document saying that I they can guarantee I will have the money 3500 kr
- Maybe split my loan in two Kreditforening and prioritetskredit (5.25 %) (always variable)
- All kreditforeninger take a fee for putting extra money on the loan
