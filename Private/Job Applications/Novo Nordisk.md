# Short description of my strengths
I am a detail oriented Senior Data Scientist with strong communication skills and a love for heavy mathematical problems. In the past, I have worked with medical data at RaySearch Laboratories. Here, I worked with medical professionals, such as oncologists, on machine learning intensive applications in Python. I also have experience training junior colleagues and have set up courses in SHAP and Git to ensure my team has the relevant knowledge to deliver quality solutions. Finally, I have often been praised for my technical communication skills with colleagues saying that I am excellent at explaining data science topics to non-technical stakeholders.
