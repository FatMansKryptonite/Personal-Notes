# Motivation for applying
Hello, I wish to apply for the open role as Experienced Data Scientist. I am motivated to transition from my current role as Senior Data Science Consultant at Valcon back into a more research-intensive environment, and I believe Lundbeck could be the perfect fit. I have previously worked in the medical industry as a Data Science Researcher at RaySearch Laboratories. In this role, I attained an in-depth grasp of radiotherapy for cancer treatment and innovatively applied machine learning to the domain. The meaningful impact on patient well-being this role provided, and the attention to detail it required deeply motivated me. This is why I choose to apply. I hope to hear back from you soon.
# Short description of my strengths
I am a detail oriented Senior Data Scientist with strong communication skills and a love for heavy mathematical problems. In the past, I have worked with medical data at RaySearch Laboratories. Here, I worked with medical professionals, such as oncologists, on machine learning intensive applications in Python. I also have experience training junior colleagues and have set up courses in SHAP and Git to ensure my team has the relevant knowledge to deliver quality solutions. Finally, I have often been praised for my technical communication skills with colleagues saying that I am excellent at explaining data science topics to non-technical stakeholders.  

# Notes
- `efficiency` is good because it is interpretable
- can we get cost efficiency in from the country variables?

# Case
A trial has 4 phases
- Design trial
- Find site
- Find patients
- Run Trial
Phase 2 and 3 seems most interesting for AI

## 2 Find site
## 3 Find patients
- Make model to find people according to advertisement/cookie/personal marker databases
