Hi,

It was a while since we talked last now, but I was in an interview process with Stephan roughly 2.5 years ago. In the end I was offered a position I unfortunately could not accept. 

Since then I have worked as a Senior Data Scientist Consultant working on many different projects in domains ranging from online retail, to power transmission and pharmaceuticals. I have learned many things in this role but I feel that it is now time for a change. Therefore, I have attached my up to date CV with a short description of why I am looking for a new job. I was hoping we could book a meeting in the near future to discuss what the team at Andel is looking for at the moment and if there are any opportunities that would suit my profile.
