- [ ] Text Nicolai Juul
- 4 in copenhagen and 3 in Ã…rhus
- Works with building deployment ready pipelines that actually work!
- No one sells project for the team apart from the team itself.
	- When they are making a sale they bring the AI team to the client to scope the project
	- When they understand the project they make a proposal themselves
- Values
	- Integrity
- Sometimes you obviously have to make powerpoints and whatnot
- They have a knowledge sharing session every week(?)
- They do a lot of machine learning but their customers are often asking for LLMs
	- The customers ask for POCs
	- [x] What is the actual request? To build chatbots?
	- They often ask for RAC (Retreival AC) where we allow users to ask LLMs about internal documents
	- They also make the platform (which vector database should they use)
	- They often work with pre-trained models rather than building their own networks
- Rather than training ML models they build applications with python using ML APIs
- They build software rather than AI. The important part is that the solution works rather than that it uses the coolest service or architecture
