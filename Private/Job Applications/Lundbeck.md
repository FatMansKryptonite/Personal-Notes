# Motivation for applying
Hello, I wish to apply for the open role as Experienced Data Scientist. I am motivated to transition from my current role as Senior Data Science Consultant at Valcon back into a more research-intensive environment, and I believe Lundbeck could be the perfect fit. I have previously worked in the medical industry as a Data Science Researcher at RaySearch Laboratories. In this role, I attained an in-depth grasp of radiotherapy for cancer treatment and innovatively applied machine learning to the domain. The meaningful impact on patient well-being this role provided, and the attention to detail it required deeply motivated me. This is why I choose to apply. I hope to hear back from you soon.
