# Role Description
## Senior Specialist -> Principal
### Quality
- I have been project leading Lundbeck where I have been the designer of the entire solution.
	- The client and Shanti are very happy with the speed at which we could do this and the quality of the work.
	- During the entire project I have been training Jane in python and Git use.
- I made sure we are able to follow proper coding practice with getting Git up and running in the Nordics.
- I have set up and run my own workshop here internally with the Energinet project.
	- I have taken proper responsibility for data quality even considering the other things I have running at the same time.
### Conceptual thinking and problem-solving
- This is like my strong suit.
	- I don't feel like I have been able to show this yet but I dreamt up the entire solution for the Lundbeck project even though I have never done anything similar before.
- Have been coaching Jane like crazy.
- Have been combining Azure knowledge, programming, programming architecture, stakeholder management etc.
### Communication
- I can communicate, not sure what more to say.
- Have held a workshop on my own initiative.
### Planning and organising
- Done all of this in Lundbeck, hands-on and coaching.
- Transferred all my thoughts to a backlog for Marija when she joined, ordered and prioritised them as well.
### Adaptability
- Oh there's been risk. I have been managing the Medicine Client project, making sure we handle sensitive data in a secure manner. Limiting expectations from Shanti and Henrik, helping Jane in meetings and checking code.
- I have been extremely adaptable, contacting the right sources withing Valcon for tips and resources.
- Have been limiting Shanti's expectations when we needed more time or when we do not know the way forward.
### Stakeholder management and client interaction
- I can communicate no problem.
- At my previous job I was given responsibility to present large projects for clients and internally. My presentation skills were extremely appreciated.
- Shanti, Henrik and Jane sure think I am an expert within anything technical.
### Collaboration
- You're the better judge of this. I think it so.
- I've been supporting Jane emotionally through her tough time on Lundbeck where she has been knee deep in things she is not familiar with through a time of high uncertainty considering her work permit.
- Doing my best to help Jane with well-being
### Personal development
- Azure training, attending databricks seminars, keeping up to date on trends in AI, ML and DS.
- Tried getting us to DDSA and made sure we moved the meeting forward so that we had a higher chance of going, alas, it was too late.
- Asked Jane, Rasmus, Mads, Patrick, and Shanti for feedback.
- Been talking to Lasse about DSB project, was eager to join call, pushed good ideas (Lasse really liked them).
- Helping Jane getting up to date on Git.
### Coaching and developing others
- Coaching Jane again.
- Been showing Jane how to better structure her code to minimise code repetition and other python nasties.
- Been a super mentor for Jane. I think she has seen me as her development leader more than anyone else.
### Practice development
- Git, how was I the first person to take charge here.
	- I want more precedence to make sure this is used properly. 
- I made sure we got up and running with our function in azure.
	- Took a hold of Patrick to help me.
### Building and maintaining relations
- Yeah, I talk to people.
- I flag like a madman, I have so many DS ideas.
	- In Client1, Client2 and in Client3.
### Commercial efforts and impact
- Pierre asked me to make a powerpoint for sales purposes, I think it was high quality.
- I was the go-to guy for this at my old work.
	- The CEO loved to talk about my presentations internally and with clients.
	- I was put on many more presentation tasks.
- I am responsible for data quality!


## Other areas
- The people in the Netherlands said "Very impressive, don't think I could have done all this in the time allotted."
- I am looking into potential new joiners with experience desperately needed in the team.
- Was the leading voice behind DDSA, which we unfortunately were too late to join.
