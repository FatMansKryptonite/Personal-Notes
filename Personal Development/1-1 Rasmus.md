# Work on myself for promotion case
- Commercial effort
	- Start recording my project ideas in a more structured manner
		- For the time being I'll do it on my own
		- In the future add to a common location
- Planning and organising
	- For principal I need to start coaching others on how to do this
- Push back
	- Push back more when third parties are blocking us
	- Being able to see the timeline is being hindered by RelateIT
- Networking
	- Keep in touch with old colleagues to land projects
	- **Patrick reached out to me to ask for a project**
## Feedback from Rasmus
- Communication skills
	- I have developed on the softer side of communication
	- I can adapt my communication style for my audience not just in technical dialogues but also in other circumstances
	- I have picked up this skill very fast
- Super good that I am pushing on Mathias on salary
	- Let's see what comes out of it
	- He will want to know if there is a real discrepancy in pay
