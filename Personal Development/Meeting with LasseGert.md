		- I showed that I possess the people (consultancy) side and the tech side during that project.
		- "I am super happy you were on this project with me. It shows that Valcon can do so much more than management consulting. You have brought a different viewpoint to the project and value I could not have given." - Joakim (paraphrasing)

# Notes from Mads
- Utilisation is high as well
	- I got a point in the bonus round
	- My utilisation was 83 % (including my 5 first weeks of training!) and still I had time for all of this internal stuff!
- Inflation, like come on
- I look into the unions recommendations
- It is very difficult trying to find a data science lead, you need to do more to keep us on board
- Have a concrete ask
	- 10 %
	- Pension

# From Lase
- [ ] Consider how we have seen you from Dec to Jan
- [ ] "I wish to correct the decision that I has been placed on the level of 3rd year senior specialist"
- [ ] "I need to be principal"
- [ ] Rebecca and Line aligned criteria for role descriptions
	- [ ] Senior specialist 1st-3rd year
		- [ ] 1st: Blanks up for development
		- [x] 2nd: Filling up most of the skills
		- [ ] 3rd: Then one starts taking more Principal responsibility
- [ ] I am ticking off Principal criteria already, so I should be 3rd year Senior Specialist.
