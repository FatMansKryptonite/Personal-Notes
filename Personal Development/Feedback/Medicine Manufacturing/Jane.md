- Try to clear your head
	- Maintain a cleaner workflow
	- Trust your tools

	- Trust that you can figure out a problem, most often you can
	- Just because you don't have a solution _now_ doesn't mean you're screwed!
- Think about what you want to do!
	- As far as I understand you had no prior coding experience but have been put on coding projects since you started. Do you actually want to code?
