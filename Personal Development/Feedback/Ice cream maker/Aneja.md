Completely unprompted, outside of feedback session Aneja said the following when I was explaining the difference between the standard deviation of the data and the standard deviation of the mean
>Aneja: "You are really good at explaining complex topics, like really, really good."
>Ivar: "Well, it's my job."
>Aneja: "I have worked with other data scientists before, and they were not nearly as good as you!"

# To
## Good
- Excellent stakeholder management in technical projects
	- B, N and S have all been challenging (in their own ways) but over all you have handled it well.
	- You have calmed B and N
	- and pushed back against S so that we stay in scope
- Knows how technical projects work to a greater degree than other people at Valcon I've worked with in the past
	- A general problem here is that people think that data science, machine learning and AI are all magic. This makes it so that they do not understand what is required to do DS projects. In addition, no one seems interested in learning why these projects can't be started before data is available, why data quality is of utmost importance and why we either have a working model or we don't.
	- People seem to think that with half the time I can produce half a model. I cannot.
	- You seem to have a better understanding of this and that is refreshing. It might be from your background in tech but for whatever reason, never forget it, please.
- You also seem somewhat interested in the work I produce rather than just seeing it as pretty pixels on some xy-plane. 
	- You ask relevant questions and question results when they do not make sense to you. This is very important!
	- A lot of the time us DS people have the misfortune of working alone on projects and then it is of utmost importance that you check the work to your best efforts.
- Makes sure the team stays together, gets to know one another, and stays motivated
	- Project dinners
	- Getting Nicolette over here
	- Arranges the trips
## Bad
- Can come off as aggressive and overly assertive.
	- This can lead to more junior colleagues becoming unsure of themselves or worried that they are not doing a good enough job.
- Don't know whose fault this was but why was my vacation not communicated to the client?
	- Led to a quite stressful vacation and an awkward situation for all of us.
	- I don't want to have to keep an eye on my phone during vacation.
	- I don't want to have to lie to clients.
## Constructive
- Overall it has been a very pleasant experience working with you.
	- Do more of what you're already doing!
	- I can imagine a lot of people with whom the car rides would have been a lot more boring than they were now.
- Make sure all data/tech projects you are on in the future have a proper initial maturity assessment phase.
	- I know you are already working on this which is great.
	- Think of in which direction you want to take your projects
		- Think of if it makes sense to include a suitable profile in the assessment phase.
- I love the sass, but early on in a project, before you know everyone well, try to tone it down a bit.
	- Especially when working with more junior colleagues who are more unsure of themselves.


# From
## Good
- "I enjoyed working with you in many ways, could have been more pessimistic and boring"
- Very good at simplifying ideas with graphs and pictures
- When I need to understand clients business which is mechanical I am good at understanding and relating that to my work in DS
- "Like my communication style internally, I always knew if we were doing well"
- I let Client know too much early on in the project
	- I learned quickly to more hold their hand and stakeholder manage them
- Being alone must have been challenging, but I think you did well at asking "What are we actually trying to do"
- We like to use words that "give as out" (if things don't work out I can back out)
- I gained experience on how to collaborate with others on a technical level

## Improvement
- I should be "promising" more than "telling the truth" (less "statistical and technically correct" and more "inspiring")
- We need to have a better process on how to share work between me and Aneja
	- Ask on every project "Where are we developing this?" Spin up cloud environment
- Projects need technical setup phase
- Sometimes when I explain things I lack context
	- When I explain a graph I dive in too quickly
	- I need to give an overview
- I need to think more about what is the simplest way to results rather than what is the "fanciest way"
- Ask "Who is the data person?", who will walk us through the data and who will we ask questions to.
