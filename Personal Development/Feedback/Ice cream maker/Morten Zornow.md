# To
## Good
- Always willing to help
- Knows everything about ice cream making and would always entertain my stupid questions
- Voiced concerns and opinions when he had them
## Bad
- There were issues with data quality that would have been great to know ahead of time. Such as:
	- Broken Counters
	- Software controlled counters
	- Improperly installed current measuring devices
	- Formatting in alarms and warnings translation files
	- Weird translations
## Constructive
- Try to be a larger presence in the room earlier on in project.
	- You clearly know loads about ice cream manufacturing and Clients's machines
	- It took a while until I realised that you were more knowledgeable about these than both S. and N.
# From
## Positive
- In general terms I really do like your constructive approach to all of this
- You listen to what Client knows and what they think they know
- You give constructive questions
- Client thinks they know a lot of things but they are not always correct
- You have spotted a few of these things ahead of time but are able to lead them in the right direction to get to the bottom of things
- With the possibilities you were given I don't think you could have done anything better than what you did
- You performed very well given the circumstances
## Negative
- The distance to the production floor in this project was too large
- We are really relying on feedback form client but it was not always sufficient a closer connection to Factory would have really helped the project along
## Constructive
- Stay closer to the factory floor next time
