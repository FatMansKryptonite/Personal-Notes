# To
## Good
- Helped out with setting up dashboards before I even joined
- Docker was a great idea for portability and if it weren't for you it wouldn't have happened
- Came to Denmark
- Experience from Heineken was very useful

## Bad
- 

## Constructive
- 


# From
## Positive
- Did demos well
- Easy connection with clients
- Your coding is clean
	- Even I could understand what you were doing
- You took your time to explain to the client what they were getting
	- You did this really well
- The only thing that could have been done better in this project is on the management and scoping phase of this project
- Morten Just might be the guy who understands what data could do, he should be the partner to sell these things
- Otherwise data scientists will start to leave
- I understand you are looking somewhere else but it would be a shame, I believe you can bring way more to the team

## Negative
- 

## Constructive
- There is a culture change needed in data in Denmark
	- If we keep going along with clients requirements and calling clustering AGI then we will never build anything serious
