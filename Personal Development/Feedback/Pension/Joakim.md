# To
## Good
- Overall 10/10 colleague
- When we didn't get data you were doing your utmost to pressure Client employees to send it over.
- You always had an open mind and wanted to understand the data science.
	- Not only did you want to understand it, you also did!
	- At least you managed to fool me.
- You had great napkin maths ideas, some which I'm mad I didn't think of myself.
	- The main thing that comes to mind is the excel calculations we did of how much money one saved due to the difference in RMST.
- You produced some killer slides.
- You let me work on my own thing without too many distractions.
	- This is of course due to the lack of prior knowledge of the subject.
	- The trust is still highly appreciated.

## Bad
- Sometimes you seem a bit unsure of yourself.
	- You often say things like:
		- "Correct me if I'm wrong here."
		- "No, that was stupid."
	- There is nothing wrong with being humble, but you're a bright guy producing great work. I believe the insecurity takes away from that a bit. 
- Letting me work on my own, though appreciated, might be risky in the future.
	- If you are working with a less competent or less motivated data scientist it is a good idea to keep up a regular discussion surrounding the progress and what we expect to deliver.
	- Normally this is done between data scientists so you were in quite a tricky position in this project only having one technical person on the team.
	- In the future, I wish Valcon realises that they cannot treat technical roles like regular consultants. 
- When you know that you have a non-danish speaker on the team it could be wise to encourage the client to speak English.
	- In my case I understand everything but it makes me very tired at the end of the day and it becomes more difficult to remember meetings.
	- I don't know what it was like with Kiri

## Constructive
- Try to be more sure of your own thoughts!
- Schedule regular status meetings on the technical part.
- Do your best to get two data scientists on every project.
	- Maybe one main and one more senior on the sideline. It is still very important that they are clearly pointed out and know what their responsibilities are.


# From
## Positive
- "Extremely good and very curious"
	- In an area I don't know very well I will dive into it and am happy explain anything.
	- I am looking for new avenues
	- This is invaluable in a consultancy where there are many old partners
- You are good at but still keep working on "being able to explain not just technical stuff but also in a business perspective"
	- I focused on days but also translated it to money.
- I am very good at living out Valcon's values
	- I'm fun to work with (<3)
	- Curious
	- Integrity
- I seem competent when it comes to DS
	- "You take pride in your work"
- Persistent in trying to find ways to work even though we didn't have data.
	- I can make excel mock-ups
	- PowerPoint examples
- My visual presentation is always good (PowerPoint-wise)

## Negative
- Be better at time boxing and explaining when I think things will be ready to deliver.
