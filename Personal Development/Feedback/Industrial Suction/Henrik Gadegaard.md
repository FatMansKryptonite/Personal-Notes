# From
## Positive
- It is obvious that I have the broad T in the "consultancy"
	- The general consultancy skills, facilitate workshops, communication etc
	- I am very well versed in the generals (he has no insight into my spike, my depth)
	- He understands I have a good depth as well though
	- This is really important for our digital team
	- A lot of people have the spike but lack the width
	- "That is a very strong capability you have there, nurture that, keep that going as you go upwards"
- You are good at communicating clearly and short, but be sure that people remember my presentation for the content and not just the jokes.
- I like your slideware
	- My slides are attention grabbing
- "You are good at communicating and getting your message across."
- Kongskilde, "Good so far, you are good at understanding the case and being curious."
- "For Friday, we need to prepare for a "final meeting" before coming with a suggestion to them. Up until now, my understanding is that you are prepared, interested, knowledgeable in your area and also professional in my dialogue with Kim."
	- "I would definitely ask you again the next time I have a proposal to make"
	- "I wouldn't hesitate in just letting you run with it"
	- You are a "safe pair of hands". I could give you the ball and you would run with it. If you dropped the ball you would inform me ahead of time to ensure we could find someone else.
## Negative
- Henrik often did presentations with jokes like myself. He was told to try giving a presentation without telling joke for once. People do not understand that he can be serious when laughing
	- There is power in being able to be short and sweet as well
	- There is a skill to be able to balance that fine line sometimes
