# To
## Good
- Cooperation
	- In general I feel cooperation has worked very well. We have been able to cleanly divide tasks, have always had something to do, and we have never done double work
	- You are easy to communicate with. You are straight forward yet have a lighthearted communication style. I like!
- Technical
	- Thanks for taking care of the deployment of the models. we could not have produced so much without you. It went very smoothly as soon as we had the compute and I could trust that there would be a working endpoint
	- What more can I say? You write quality code! I feel like I can learn some best practices from working with you and that is an uncommon feeling for me since joining Valcon
	- Thank you for taking charge of DevOps as soon as you joined the project. You stepped in and quickly identified that we had a huge need for proper development practices and implemented them without hesitation
## Bad
- A little more effort when it comes to stuff you do not enjoy
	- Writing emails
	- Making slides
	- Being client facing
	- I feel like I had to thoroughly convince you to send an email to the client at times
		- When the API was down for instance
- You were very rarely in the office and at times I feel like it hampered our collaboration
- You forgot the note down tasks at times and I ended up having to remind you
## Constructive
- Try to take more of a client friendly/facing role when appropriate
- Please be here more often
- Make sure to note down tasks when asked to do something
	- DevOps is brilliant, but when we are in the car on our way back from Esbjerg and have a few tasks for you maybe you should be the one to put them in DevOps
- Goes for both you and me. We need to be more firm on that we cannot/will not do certain things when we don't think they make sense.
# From
## Positive
- Väldigt pålitlig att jobba med
	- Allt jag gör från kommunikation, till implementation, sätta upp möten gör jag väl
	- Implementering får jag ett extra plus. Väldigt komplext under väldigt kort tid och det har funkar
- Business understanding
	- Har bra kontakt med BELFOR
- Väldigt roligt att jobba med mig
	- Man känner sig aldrig stressad eller utmattad av att jobba med någon som mig. Jag ser till att teamet mår bra
## Constructive
- If we get an extension how can we start working differently then
	- Mer "long term thinking"
		- Hur implementerar man en ny feature i lösningen?
		- Hur kommer den featuren bete sig i framtiden
		- Bli bättre på dokumentation
	- Planning
		- Hur jag har använt DevOps
		- Tickets med titel utan beskrivning. En ticket skal kunna ges till en annan utvecklare utan vidare förklaring
	- Mer pushback hela tiden
		- Säg till Rasmus, "fuck off"!
	- Increase knowledge sharing within the team
		- Developer meeting discussing how features are implemented
		- Discuss training results
		- Discuss the feature set of the dashboard
