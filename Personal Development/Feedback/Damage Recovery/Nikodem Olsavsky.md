First of all, it's a pleasure to work with you. I had an amazing time working at BELFOR despite being criticized for my optimism regularly. Anyway, to the point - you are really great at voicing your opinion and you have looots of good ideas to improve things and hence whatever you are voicing may seem like complaining. Getting to know you better I don't think it is the case, although delivery of some points may be too harsh for some people. In any case, I feel like Valcon is not recognising this ability enough and staff you on shorter term projects that are kinda random. I believe this is a bit of a waste. Working on longer term projects where you get a lot of interactions with the client would suit you (and Valcon) much better. You have a great ability to connect with people and that can lead to a lot of work at the client. And if anyone else from Valcon reads that and disagrees - just the fact that so many colleagues come asking you for your opinion and ideas is insane. You have really established yourself as a trusted data team member for our consultants as they definitely do not consult other team members about data as much - likely just showing that your knowledge and ability to convey complex information in simple terms is superior. Back to the point in the 2nd paragraph - I believe that if you are longer term on a big account, it is a question of time before clients would start doing that, Valcon will get soooo many more leads within those accounts.
