# From
## Good
- Done great
- Picked up the responsibility to get hings moving
- There is a solution live that works and I think that is a really nice accomplishment
- Good having me in the DEMOs
- My presentation technique is very good, works with the business users
## Bad
- We should have aligned closer ahead of the SteerCos so I am the person speaking a bit more
	- Rasmus should try to push me forward more
## Constructive
- It is difficult to do everything perfectly when there is so much pressure and so much to do. But, if there had been more time
	- Push Rasmus more to give me more responsibility in discussions with stakeholders
	- No work was happening on releasing the new version of the model. Align better before going on vacation
	- Clearer on priorities
