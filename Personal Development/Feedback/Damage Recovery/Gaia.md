# To
## Good
- Stakeholder management
	- Your stakeholder management skills have been astounding
	- Your ability to take charge of the test sessions and make clients trust us is amazing
- Tech
	- We haven't worked closely in a tech capacity but when I have discovered problems you 
- General
	- This project would have gotten nowhere without you! You started in January and immediately stepped up and grabbed all tasks you saw needed doing.have sorted them out in a timely manner
	- You have been the spider in the web making sure this product took off in the way it did.
- Personal
	- Ja-hat. Throughout, this has been a fun and positive project and that is thanks to you. Had it not been for your presence Rickard, Rasmus, and I would have started being negative about the project straight away and we would have had a generally miserable time
- Thank you
## Bad
- I don't know how you have been able to cope these last few weeks with all the tasks on your plate. I know you don't want me saying it, but you need to work less. I myself could never have done what you did and I do not want to see this job negatively impact your personal life. You are not paid enough for that
## Constructive
- Learn to say "No" and "Stop"
	- Especially internally
- Learn to offload tasks on colleagues. I can imagine that since BELFOR is a Danish organisation and you were to only one of Rickard, you, I with professional Danish that it might have been tricky to do so though

	- Esbjerg, where I got mad it was very visible on me. Rasmus and Gaia though it was fine but other people might not
- In the beginning I had a "I don't give a fuck attitude"
	- Not about the product and project
	- But I kept my distance to it
	- But I actually do care about both the project, the product and my colleagues
	- This is probably a defence mechanism to be able to step back and say "I said so" when a project doesn't go as planned
- Focus more on code quality checks and the PRs and making sure the 
	- Try to lay out a more structured work environment for collaboration
