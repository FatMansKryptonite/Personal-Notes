Max Ronander and I attended the conference AI Strategy Summit in Stockholm shortly after me having presented a client case on Friday news. Max mentioned how he was very grateful that I gave such a clear and memorable presentation, because he really felt like he understood how the solution was built up with its separate parts. In a conversation with another client, he had gone on and explained what we had done there and really felt like he could show off a little and have them understand that we know how to build machine learning solutions.
