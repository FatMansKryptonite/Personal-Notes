**Completely Unprompted**, Paraphrasing: 
- "That was a really good presentation, I believe people learned a lot from that and see how machine learning can be applied in a much wider scope."

# Eleonora
**Completely Unprompted 1 week after the presentation**, Paraphrasing:
- "I forgot to mention it after the presentation but your Friday news presentation last week was really good. It was the best one I've heard for Friday news yet. To present something that is so far outside of what I normally do and still I felt like I understood and learned something, while you held my attention, brilliant. I loved it."
- Louise: "Mmmh, yeah, really good."
