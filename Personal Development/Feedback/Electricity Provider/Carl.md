# To
## Good
- Strong leadership
- Took charge

## Bad
- I said I could do more with more time. We rescheduled from Monday to Wednesday.
- Too many ad-hoc tasks. Every time I'm interrupted it takes probably 30 min to get back to the same train of thought.
- Try not to overwork your resources.

## Constructive
- Normally clustering projects are done over a series of months with continuous feedback from clients. We did this on way to short of a time frame. Try to change that in the future. DS is not suited for "RAPIDS".
- Try to collect your tasks together and ask them all at once. This also makes it so that I can better plan how to produce all of the relevant insights.![[Pasted image 20230509092417.png]]
- Have continuous status meetings.
- Set realistic expectations 

# From
## Positive
- Give push back based on realism. I do not use gut feeling but rather base it on experience and examples.
- I put in a great effort in terms of clarifying what we are trying to solving for. People working with data do not always communicate what they are doing.
- Picked it up fast and worked fast! Really good, especially in a rapid process. "We moved exponentially all of a sudden."
- When we communicate we try to be specific. I do this.
- "Very valuable add-on"

## Negative
- Carl had a feeling that me and Laura were not always in sync on what was going on or being done. Me and Laura were not always cooperating well.
- Too many layers of communication and things got lost in communication.
- More visible in the client facing situations, Carl doesn't feel like I got enough credit for what I did. I bring credibility but I wasn't present enough in workshops with clients. I didn't fully capture the value I could have.
- Carl didn't feel comfortable that the data was clean enough, or that we understood the columns. We shifted between using different columns.

"It was very good to have you onboard. I appreciate you could step in and do it."
