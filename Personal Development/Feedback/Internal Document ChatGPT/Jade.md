# To
## Good
- Not technical but you care to take the time to understand. I cannot ask for more
- Very good stakeholder manager
## Bad
- During GRAM, I think Aneja would have liked you to take a little more of an active role
	- She still did very well though
## Constructive
- Think about how you formulate yourself from time to time. I found it funny, and I appreciate it, but Per might not. I don't know him well enough
# From
## Positive
- I am a specialist but I can also see the opportunities on the commercial side
- When a project goes up in flames I am normally the person who is called in to fix it
- Setting up BELFOR was super good
- I tell people what I do which creates a clear environment
## Negative
- Be sure to communicate that I really want to be on project X but I need help to get that time in TEM
- Keep the things that are not my problem not my problem
## Constructive
- Make a structured overview of all that I have done in the PDD document
	- Even consider the senior principal things, am I in there on some points?
- Think about what it is I bring to Valcon that they can benefit the most from
	- I use humour to ensure people remember what I say
	- I can explain complicated things easily
- Mention to Rasmus that I am being reached out to by everyone, and I am already negotiating with my time to get more resources to help me out with my tasks
