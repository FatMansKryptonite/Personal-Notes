This document is meant to track what I have done during my time at Valcon. It will be used to build a promotion case and for future reference.

# Internal
## Building Data Science
### Git Course
For an early project at Client I noticed the lack of a git environment and git knowledge in the Nordics. Since I am a firm believer of version control software I set out to find someone in the Dutch offices that could give us a git course. This was unfortunately not possible so I decided to design one myself. Since I don't consider myself a git expert I employed the help of Rickard and together we designed a git course which was highly appreciated. We were asked to give it again less than one month later!
### Hiring
I early on noticed the lack of a data science lead and decided to get involved. I have been in close contact with recruiters and provided them with a specification for what we are looking for. Additionally, I have partaken in a multitude of interviews with both junior and senior candidates.
## Greatest Start
### Developing Jane

# Energy Infrastructure Client
At Client I have taken the role as quality responsible. This quickly turned into a non-role due to the nature of the project.

During the project I have
- Helped build relations with Tove, Niels, Lasse and Kristine
- Developed the GTO data catalogue

# Pension Client
Joakim and I have together built a strong presentation and business case in the short time frame given. My main responsibilities involved cleaning and analysing the data in order to verify internal results and to investigate what value can be extracted from the data as-is. This was completed in approximately 1 week (a week where I was sick) and considering the extremely short time frame loads has been achieved. The analysis done involved
- Cleaning of data set
	- Extracting useful columns
	- Aggregating columns
	- Renaming columns
	- Translating columns
	- Remapping entries
- Extracting relevant data points
	- Via selection rules
	- Propensity score matching (in an attempt to mimic Mikael's previous work)
- Data analysis
	- Kaplan-Meier estimates
	- CoxPHEstimates
	- RMST calculations
	- SHAP explainer analysis

# Medicine Client
Early on I was asked to go over to Malm√∂ a few times a week and support Jane on a development project for Client. I took on this project even though it is something I have never worked with before. I was the tech lead on that project while simultaneously working on Energinet and working on internal projects.

In this project I acted as the project architect and was main responsible for implementation and automation.
