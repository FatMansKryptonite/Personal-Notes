	- [x] What does he need to consider me for promotion? 
		- At some point going from a senior specialist to principal you realise what you are really good at and what your flaws are. You use this knowledge to get the right team built and set up for success. Figure out where I need to improve instead.
	- [x] Where am I lacking?
		- It comes across quite clearly that you are insanely bright. You see problems and solutions faster than other people in the room. Learn to be more easy going about what you say and give other people room. It comes across as very sharp and aggressive. Understand how you affect the room.

	- What are my development points. It is important
- [x] What is the significance of "within own area of expertise" when filling out the PDD.
	- As specialists we do not need to manage the non-technical parts of the projects. We our job is to make sure that "our delivery" is taken care of.
	- As a principal you make sure that problems are spotted early and that the right resources are brought on.
	- As a principal you make sure we know how to cooperate across the different parts of a project (technical and non-technical).
- [x] What are the expectations for a generalist vs a specialist, and how is this reflected in the career framework?
	- The specialist leaves something behind (they deliver a product). They need to make sure this product is of quality. They foresee risks that might lead to the project not being adopted.
	- It is okay to be super specialised and not be able to do loads of types of work but rather being very knowledgeable in one domain. It might be a little bit difficult though.
- [x] A lot of areas I am not "Above expectations" in is simply because I have not been given the opportunity to show that. How does that affect my situation? What can I do if this is not given to me?
	- "It is what it is." The reflection can make it so that the entire promotion case can stumble (don't bring it up). Focus on the positive instead when doing the promotion case. 
	- What is unique for me is "All the interactions I have had I have gotten into projects that have been off balance. I have been putting these back on track, and doing these successfully. All of them are characterised by being put in a terrible complex mess and having to deliver quality anyway. On modstrøm I came and saved the project and I do not have the personality that I need to go around and tell everyone how well I performed."
- [x] What is the significance of internal activities?
	- Do not try and say that I have led a team if I haven't necessarily gotten that opportunity.
	- If we could make Vion happen that would be great for promotion.
