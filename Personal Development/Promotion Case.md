## Bad

## Constructive
- I am quite a perfectionist. Try to use this to help others solve problems rather than just pointing out issues.
- Stakeholder management, I haven't had chance on projects, but manage people more effectively internally as well.
- Be more open minded towards non technical people.
- Communicate issues more carefully to consider other peoples' feelings.
- Know when to do stuff myself and when to pull in other people.
